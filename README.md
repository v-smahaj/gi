# Great Ideas App Template

Most enterprises run innovation contests from time to time generally or on specific topics/themes to crowdsource new, unique ideas from their employees. Great Ideas app is a result of this trend. While innovation contests are run only for a specific period, this app is meant to enable enterprise employees to route their best ideas from anywhere, at any time to rightly qualified, designated personnel in the company – thereby kicking off a culture of round the year innovation. This app template is for employees, team leaders and organizational leaders who believe in democratizing idea generation.

Great Ideas app is an “innovation challenge” system that lets employees submit and share ideas and insights, with voting right within Microsoft Teams. Employees can submit an innovative idea in a selected category to be visible to all colleagues and leadership, ideas can be voted upon and a leader board of best idea contributors can be shared. 

## Key features

- Ideate and collaborate with your peers
- Gamifying employee engagement and encouragement using the concept of upvotes
- Proper governance and reviews of Ideas by a team of curators to ensure they are appropriately clubbed under categories relevant to the organization. 
	
  
The app workflow is described below:
1. Discover new ideas that have been created by your peers in the organization in the All Ideas tab

2. Search for ideas based on your subjects of interest using tags etc. and Upvote them

3. Collaborate using the Messaging extension, share the ideas you find interesting to garner more interest from your peers

4. Install the app in a team and set up your monthly or weekly digest as per your preferences to stay updated on any new ideas that have been submitted

5. Configure the tab in a Channel filtered based on tags to look for any ideas that are based on the topics or areas of expertise relevant to your team
